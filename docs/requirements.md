The goal of this work is to agree on an interoperable consensus protocol that meets the following requirements:

* MUST withstand a sigificant fraction of malfunctioning / malicious actors (around 1/3 of nodes);
* MUST have a formal proof of correctness that we can show to regulators;
* MUST guarantee the robustness property for consensus protocols with immediate finality
* SHOULD have a specification sufficient to enable implemetation without having to refer to someone else's code;
