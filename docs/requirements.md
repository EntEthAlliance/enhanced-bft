The goal of this work is to agree on an interoperable consensus protocol that meets the following requirements:

* MUST guarantee Optimal Byzantine Fault Tolerance for Partially Synchronous and Asynchronous Networks
* MUST have a formal proof of correctness that we can show to regulators;
* MUST guarantee timely finality;
* SHOULD have a specification sufficient to enable implemetation without having to refer to someone else's code;
